## Executive Summary: This chapter is about hardware and the components that represent memory and the motherboard its self.


## Hardware: components of computers that goes from desktop,laptop,mobile etc

### Hard Drives and Memory: platters that rotates and the faster it goes the more data  and memory is opened

#### Latency and Transfer Rates: latency is how long the hard drive takes to read from a specific location that data is stored .Transfer is when the speed of data reached the disk media also the megabytes used by the second .

#### Solid State vs. Hard Drives : solid state is a device that use solid state memory to store data. Hard drives is used for long term storage .

#### Random Access Memory: loads information from the storage into working memory. And example is double data rate 

### ALU and the Control Unit: digital circuit can preform arithmetic and logic operations .

### CPU, Input & Output: CPU is caring out commands being sent from the software. Input & output are apart of the motherboard which are specific ports for different devices .

### Logic Gates :electric circuit with two  inputs and output . receives income currents from two  .

### IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design:  For a institute of electrical and electronics engineers .

## Data Representation: data that is stored and processed 

### Decimal, Binary, and Hexadecimal:  The difference between all 3 is hexadecimal  is it use a  base -sixteen . Binary only use two number which are 1 & 0 .

### Hexadecimal Color Representation: color codes  used with red, green and blue 

## Conclusion
This chapter was my favorite . My favorite about this chapter was learning about the motherboard of course . It the most important part of the computer when comes to dealing with CPU, memory etc. Overall my option the solid state drives is better then the hard disk drive , its convenient in suspense and much lighter but way more expensive. Such as laptops or tablets . i enjoyed this chapter.
